        <h1>happy independence day to every indian </h1>
        <p>
            Freedom does not come without a price, nor did ours. Never forget the bloodshed and brutality that this great nation has endured in the past Patriotism is not a badge that you should carry on your shoulder. You should carry it in your heart and let your
            actions speak for it. May Almighty grant us all the strength to make this country self-sufficient, happy, and prosperous. May this Independence Day be the beginning of a new future! May this Independence Day bring unity and prosperity to your
            family. May the stories of bravery of our freedom fighters inspire you to achieve big things in life. May the spirit of this day give you the courage to chase your dreams no matter where they take you. You are among the bravest and the brightest
            of all because you belong to the greatest nation in the world. Thank you to all the brave fighters who sacrificed their lives to make us one of the greatest and proudest nations in the world. Happy Independence Day!
